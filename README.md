This repository contains the code for a prospective gestural interface for artists & performers. 

I call it **Movzart** â€” the word's an amalgamation of _'Movement'_ & _'Mozart'_ since it tracks the motion of your bare hands and lets you compose music on a laptop/mobile device. It captures your hands using your device's camera and currently lets you produce sound by creating pinching-gestures with your fingers. You can customize the sound for each finger. You have an array of 12 Major & 12 Minor chords to choose from.

## Current Stack
Next.js, TailwindCSS, MediaPipe, and Tone.js among other things. The project is still ðŸš§ WIP as of 24 May 2022.
